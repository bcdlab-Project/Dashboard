        ___     _,.--.,_         Elephant.io is a socket.io client written in PHP.

          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## Installation

We are suggesting you to use composer, using `composer require elephantio/elephant.io`. For other ways, you can check the release page, or the git clone urls.

## Usage

To use Elephant.io to communicate with socket.io server is described as follows.

```php
<?php

use ElephantIO\Client;

$url = 'http://localhost:8080';

// if client option is omitted then it will use latest client available,
// aka. version 4.x
$options = ['client' => Client::CLIENT_4X];

$client = Client::create($url, $options);
$client->connect();
$client->of('/'); // can be omitted if connecting to default namespace

// emit an event to the server
$data = ['username' => 'my-user'];
$client->emit('get-user-info', $data);

// wait an event to arrive
// beware when waiting for response from server, the script may be killed if
// PHP max_execution_time is reached
if ($packet = $client->wait('user-info')) {
    // an event has been received, the result will be a \ElephantIO\Engine\Packet class
    // data property contains the first argument
    // args property contains array of arguments, [$data, ...]
    $data = $packet->data;
    $args = $packet->args;
    // access data
    $email = $data['email'];
}

// end session
$client->disconnect();
```

## Options

Elephant.io accepts options to configure the internal engine such as passing headers, providing additional
authentication token, or providing stream context.

* `headers`

  An array of key-value pair to be sent as request headers. For example, pass a bearer token to the server.

  ```php
  <?php

  $options = [
      'headers' => [
          'Authorization' => 'Bearer MYTOKEN',
      ]
  ];
  $client = Client::create($url, $options);
  ```

* `auth`

  Specify an array to be passed as handshake. The data to be passed depends on the server implementation.

  ```php
  <?php

  $options = [
      'auth' => [
          'user' => 'user@example.com',
          'token' => 'my-secret-token',
      ]
  ];
  $client = Client::create($url, $options);
  ```

  On the server side, those data can be accessed using:

  ```js
  io.use((socket, next) => {
      const user = socket.handshake.auth.user;
      const token = socket.handshake.auth.token;
      // do something with data
  });
  ```

* `context`

  A [stream context](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-context-create.php) options for the socket stream.

  ```php
  <?php

  $options = [
      'context' => [
          'http' => [],
          'ssl' => [],
      ]
  ];
  $client = Client::create($url, $options);
  ```

* `persistent`

  The socket connection by default will be using a persistent connection. If you prefer for some
  reasons to disable it, set `persistent` to `false`.

* `reuse_connection`

  Enable or disable existing connection reuse, by default the engine will reuse existing
  connection. To disable to reuse existing connection set `reuse_connection` to `false`.

* `transports`

  An array of enabled transport. Set to `null` or combination of `polling` or `websocket` to enable
  specific transport.

* `transport`

  Initial socket transport used to connect to server, either `polling` or `websocket` is supported.
  The default transport used is `polling` and it will be upgraded to `websocket` if the server offer
  to upgrade and `transports` option does not exclude `websocket`.

  To connect to server with `polling` only transport:

  ```php
  <?php

  $options = [
      'transport' => 'polling',     // can be omitted as polling is default transport
      'transports' => ['polling'],
  ];
  $client = Client::create($url, $options);
  ```

  To connect to server with `websocket` only transport:

  ```php
  <?php

  $options = [
      'transport' => 'websocket',
  ];
  $client = Client::create($url, $options);
  ```

## Methods

Elephant.io client (`ElephantIO\Client`) provides the following api methods:

* `initialize()` _deprecated_

   An alias to `connect()`.

* `connect()`

  Connect to socket.io server. In case of server connection is unsuccessful, an exception
  `ElephantIO\Exception\SocketException` will be thrown. It also connects to default
  `/` namespace and will trigger `ElephantIO\Exception\UnsuccessfulOperationException`
  upon unsuccessful attempts.

* `close()` _deprecated_

   An alias to `disconnect()`.

* `disconnect()`

  Disconnect from server and free some resources.

* `of($namespace)`

  Connect to a namespace, see `connect()` above for possible errors.

* `emit($event, array $args)`

  Send an event to server.

* `wait($event, $timeout = 0)`

  Wait an event to be received from server.

* `drain($timeout = 0)`

  Drain and get returned packet from server, used to receive data from server
  when we are not expecting an event to arrive.

* `getEngine()`

  Get the underlying socket engine.

## Debugging

It's sometime necessary to get the verbose output for debugging. Elephant.io utilizes `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface`
for this purpose.

```php
<?php

use ElephantIO\Client;
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;
use Psr\Log\LogLevel;

$url = 'http://localhost:8080';
$logfile = __DIR__ . '/socket.log';

$logger = new Logger('elephant.io');
$logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler($logfile, LogLevel::DEBUG)); // set LogLevel::INFO for brief logging

$options = ['logger' => $logger];

$client = Client::create($url, $options);
```

Here is an example of debug logging:
